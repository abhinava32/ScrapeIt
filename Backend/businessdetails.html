CUSTOMER REVIEWS
"Technibond has been a preferred supplier of FP Tapes limited in Ireland since 2004. Since that time we have had the benefit of doing business with a Company that has a high commitment to service. Deliveries are on time and the quality and presentation of their products is of a very high standard. Our business is twenty five years old, and in all that time we have not had another distributor that would meet the exacting standards that Technibond applies to their business. It is indeed a pleasure to do business with this Company."
Geraldine Healy, MD
F P Tapes
"Boyland Joinery supply high quality joinery products, including timber windows that carry a comprehensive guarantee. We require high quality components and have used Technibond since 2003. Technibond provided glazing and bonding tapes plus advice and application equipment that not only saved us money, but allowed us to bring all our glazing in-house to improve performance and quality. Additionally Technibond always delivers on time and provides an excellent Technical response to our queries."

"... very happy with the service, we get a delivery at the end or very early in the month regular as clockwork and the customers love the product. Keep it up! Have a great Christmas!"

"Just a quick thank you for despatching samples requested for 8mm and 16mm foam. Very much appreciated the length sent to enable me to build a complete prototype panel. Especially to the female who took the call for help and friendly manner and kindness. Have a good weekend! Best Regards!"

Frequently Asked Questions
What are your standard roll widths?
We slit most of our products to order, so we have no standard roll width. If you want 13mm or 133mm, you can have it.
What is the minimum and maximum roll width?
As a standard, the minimum is 6mm. We can slit most products narrower than this (we have slit down to 1.6mm) but we charge the same per roll as if it were 6mm, due to the increased slitting and packaging difficulty and the increased waste. The maximum width depends on the product, but is usually at least 1 metre.
Are the products held in stock?
We hold large quantities of bulk rolls in stock and manufacture to order. That's the only way we can offer the number of products and product variations that we do.
What is your delivery time?
UK deliveries on rolls, 3 to 5 working days. Spools, pads and die-cuts are 10 working days. If your order is urgent, please speak to our sales department and we'll try to help. Export orders are subject to longer delivery times.
How much do I have to order?
Our MOQ on most rolls is £100. On rolls of Techniflex and on other formats it is £200.
What are the delivery charges?
On UK orders over £200 delivery is free. On orders between £100 and £200 we add a small order charge of £20. We can arrange a.m. and courier deliveries for additional charges.
What is your returns policy?
As our products are made to order, we cannot generally accept returns unless the goods are faulty.
What guarantees do you offer?
We are proud to guarantee the quality and performance of all our products and will quickly provide a replacement or refund if they fail to meet our standards.
Do you export, if so where?
Yes, we export around the world. Currently we export to Europe, the Far East, Australia and the US.
