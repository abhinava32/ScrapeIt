About us
We are one of Africa‚Äôs largest and longest-established private energy companies and are proud to have been contributing to the development of sub-Saharan Africa since December 1987. With our trading arm Addax Energy and our other subsidiaries, we source, store, package, process and distribute the fuels, LPG and lubricants that power economies across the region.
Oryx Energies serves consumers through retail outlets (service stations and retailers), as well as providing products and on-site services for companies and public entities across a wide range of sectors, including manufacturing, the hospitality industry, agriculture, mining, construction and public works, as well as maritime operations.
Over the years, we have pioneered investments in the strategic storage of fuels and LPG, opened lubricants blending plants in East and West Africa and made major investments in LPG as a cleaner, healthier and more ecological fuel for businesses and consumers.
Three values characterise everything we do: Alert, Principled and Adaptable. They are at the heart of everything we do and guide all of our commercial activities.
